  abstract: "In most scientific domains, the deep learning community has largely focused on the quality of deep generative models, resulting in highly accurate and successful solutions. However, this race for quality comes at a tremendous computational cost, which incurs vast energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of this problem are the measures that we use as a scientific community to evaluate our work. In this paper, we suggest relying on a multi-objective measure based on Pareto optimality, which takes into account both the quality of the model and its energy consumption. By applying our measure on the current state-of-the-art in generative audio models, we show that it can drastically change the significance of the results. We believe that this type of metric can be widely used by the community to evaluate their work, while putting computational cost – and in fine energy consumption – in the spotlight of deep learning research."

  abstract: "Despite significant advances in deep models for music generation, the use of these techniques remains restricted to expert users. Before being democratized among musicians, generative models must first provide expressive control over the generation, as this conditions the integration of deep generative models in creative workflows. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a deep generative audio model providing expressive and continuous descriptor-based control, while remaining lightweight enough to be embedded in a hardware synthesizer. We enforce the controllability of real-time generation by explicitly removing salient musical features in the latent space using an adversarial confusion criterion. User-specified features are then reintroduced as additional conditioning information, allowing for continuous control of the generation, akin to a synthesizer knob. We assess the performance of our method on a wide variety of sounds including instrumental, percussive and speech recordings while providing both timbre and attributes transfer, allowing new ways of generating sounds."

  abstract: "Machine learning approaches now achieve impressive generation capabilities in numerous domains such as image, audio or video. However, most training & evaluation frameworks revolve around the idea of strictly modelling the original data distribution rather than trying to extrapolate from it. This precludes the ability of such models to diverge from the original distribution and, hence, exhibit some creative traits. In this paper, we propose various perspectives on how this complicated goal could ever be achieved, and provide preliminary results on our novel training objective called Bounded Adversarial Divergence (BAD)."

  abstract: "The development of generative Machine Learning (ML) models in creative practices, enabled by the recent improvements in usability and availability of pre-trained models, is raising more and more interest among artists, practitioners and performers. Yet, the introduction of such techniques in artistic domains also revealed multiple limitations that escape current evaluation methods used by scientists. Notably, most models are still unable to generate content that lay outside of the domain defined by the training dataset. In this paper, we propose an alternative prospective framework, starting from a new general formulation of ML objectives, that we derive to delineate possible implications and solutions that already exist in the ML literature (notably for the audio and musical domain). We also discuss existing relations between generative models and computational creativity and how our framework could help address the lack of creativity in existing models."

  authors: Antoine Caillon, Philippe Esling

  arxiv: 2204.07064
  abstract: "Deep learning models are mostly used in an offline inference fashion. However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified training and can impact the resulting audio quality. In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio workstation with real-time neural audio synthesis on a laptop CPU."

  abstract: "Deep learning models have provided extremely successful methods in most application fields by enabling unprecedented accuracy in various tasks. For audio applications, although the massive complexity of generative models allows handling complex temporal structures, it often precludes their real-time use on resource-constrained hardware platforms, particularly pervasive in this field. The lack of adequate lightweight models is an impediment to the development of stand-alone instruments based on deep models, entailing a significant limitation for real-life creation by musicians and composers. Recently, we built the first deep learning-based music instrument by implementing a lightweight generative musical audio model on an adequate hardware platform that can handle its complexity. By embedding this deep model, we provide a controllable and flexible creative hardware interface. More precisely, we focused our work on the Eurorack synthesizers format, which offers Control Voltage (CV) and gate mechanisms allowing to interact with other classical Eurorack modules."

  authors: Antoine Caillon, Philippe Esling
  date: 2021-11-09
  arxiv: 2111.05011
  abstract: "Deep generative models applied to audio have improved by a large margin the state-of-the-art in many speech and music related tasks. However, as raw waveform modelling remains an inherently difficult task, audio generative models are either computationally intensive, rely on low sampling rates, are complicated to control or restrict the nature of possible signals. Among those models, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by exposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis quality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder (RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We introduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning and adversarial fine-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the latent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction fidelity and the representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the raw waveform, we show that our model is the first able to generate 48kHz audio signals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a standard laptop CPU. We evaluate synthesis quality using both quantitative and qualitative subjective experiments and show the superiority of our approach compared to existing models. Finally, we present applications of our model for timbre transfer and signal compression. All of our source code and audio examples are publicly available."

  abstract: Current state-of-the-art results in Music Information Retrieval are largely dominated by deep learning approaches. These provide unprecedented accuracy across all tasks. However, the consistently overlooked downside of these models is their stunningly massive complexity, which seems concomitantly crucial to their success. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a model pruning method based on the lottery ticket hypothesis. We modify the original approach to allow for explicitly removing parameters, through structured trimming of entire units, instead of simply masking individual weights. This leads to models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and number of operations. We show that our proposal can remove up to 90% of the model parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios (removing up to 85% of a network), lighter models consistently outperform their heavier counterparts. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum transcription and onset estimation. The resulting ultra-light deep learning models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with minimal degradation of accuracy.

  abstract: "Extraction of symbolic information from signals is an active field of research enabling numerous applications especially in the Musical Information Retrieval domain. This complex task, that is also related to other topics such as pitch extraction or instrument recognition, is a demanding subject that gave birth to numerous approaches, mostly based on advanced signal processing-based algorithms. However, these techniques are often non-generic, allowing the extraction of definite physical properties of the signal (pitch, octave), but not allowing arbitrary vocabularies or more general annotations. On top of that, these techniques are one-sided, meaning that they can extract symbolic data from an audio signal, but cannot perform the reverse process and make symbol-to-signal generation. In this paper, we propose an bijective approach for signal/symbol translation by turning this problem into a density estimation task over signal and symbolic domains, considered both as related random variables. We estimate this joint distribution with two different variational auto-encoders, one for each domain, whose inner representations are forced to match with an additive constraint, allowing both models to learn and generate separately while allowing signal-to-symbol and symbol-to-signal inference. In this article, we test our models on pitch, octave and dynamics symbols, which comprise a fundamental step towards music transcription and label-constrained audio generation. In addition to its versatility, this system is rather light during training and generation while allowing several interesting creative uses that we outline at the end of the article."

  date: 2020-08-04
  arxiv: 2008.01370
  abstract: "Recent studies show the ability of unsupervised models to learn invertible audio representations using Auto-Encoders. They enable high-quality sound synthesis but a limited control since the latent spaces do not disentangle timbre properties. The emergence of disentangled representations was studied in Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), and has been applied to audio. Using an additional perceptual regularization can align such latent representation with the previously established multi-dimensional timbre spaces, while allowing continuous inference and synthesis. Alternatively, some specific sound attributes can be learned as control variables while unsupervised dimensions account for the remaining features. New possibilities for timbre manipulations are enabled with generative neural networks, although the exploration and the creative use of their representations remain little. The following experiments are led in cooperation with two composers and propose new creative directions to explore latent sound synthesis of musical timbres, using specifically designed interfaces (Max/MSP, Pure Data) or mappings for descriptor-based synthesis."

  abstract: "Creativity is a deeply debated topic, as this concept is arguably quintessential to our humanity. Across different epochs, it has been infused with an extensive variety of meanings relevant to that era. Along these, the evolution of technology have provided a plurality of novel tools for creative purposes. Recently, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), through deep learning approaches, have seen proficient successes across various applications. The use of such technologies for creativity appear in a natural continuity to the artistic trend of this century. However, the aura of a technological artefact labeled as intelligent has unleashed passionate and somewhat unhinged debates on its implication for creative endeavors. In this paper, we aim to provide a new perspective on the question of creativity at the era of AI, by blurring the frontier between social and computational sciences. To do so, we rely on reflections from social science studies of creativity to view how current AI would be considered through this lens. As creativity is a highly context-prone concept, we underline the limits and deficiencies of current AI, requiring to move towards artificial creativity. We argue that the objective of trying to purely mimic human creative traits towards a self-contained ex-nihilo generative machine would be highly counterproductive, putting us at risk of not harnessing the almost unlimited possibilities offered by the sheer computational power of artificial agents."

  abstract: "Deep learning models have provided extremely successful solutions in most audio application fields. However, the high accuracy of these models comes at the expense of a tremendous computation cost. This aspect is almost always overlooked in evaluating the quality of proposed models. However, models should not be evaluated without taking into account their complexity. This aspect is especially critical in audio applications, which heavily relies on specialized embedded hardware with real-time constraints. In this paper, we build on recent observations that deep models are highly overparameterized, by studying the lottery ticket hypothesis on deep generative audio models. This hypothesis states that extremely efficient small sub-networks exist in deep models and would provide higher accuracy than larger models if trained in isolation. However, lottery tickets are found by relying on unstructured masking, which means that resulting models do not provide any gain in either disk size or inference time. Instead, we develop here a method aimed at performing structured trimming. We show that this requires to rely on global selection and introduce a specific criterion based on mutual information. First, we confirm the surprising result that smaller models provide higher accuracy than their large counterparts. We further show that we can remove up to 95% of the model weights without significant degradation in accuracy. Hence, we can obtain very light models for generative audio across popular methods such as Wavenet, SING or DDSP, that are up to 100 times smaller with commensurate accuracy. We study the theoretical bounds for embedding these models on Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and show that we can obtain generative models on CPU with equivalent quality as large GPU models. Finally, we discuss the possibility of implementing deep generative audio models on embedded platforms."

  abstract: "Generative models have thrived in computer vision, enabling unprecedented image processes. Yet the results in audio remain less advanced. Our project targets real-time sound synthesis from a reduced set of high-level parameters, including semantic controls that can be adapted to different sound libraries and specific tags. These generative variables should allow expressive modulations of target musical qualities and continuously mix into new styles. To this extent we train AEs on an orchestral database of individual note samples, along with their intrinsic attributes: note class, timbre domain and extended playing techniques. We condition the decoder for control over the rendered note attributes and use latent adversarial training for learning expressive style parameters that can ultimately be mixed. We evaluate both generative performances and latent representation. Our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the musical conditioning mechanisms. The proposed model generates notes as magnitude spectrograms from any probabilistic latent code samples, with expressive control of orchestral timbres and playing styles. Its training data subsets can directly be visualized in the 3D latent representation. Waveform rendering can be done offline with GLA. In order to allow real-time interactions, we fine-tune the decoder with a pretrained MCNN and embed the full waveform generation pipeline in a plugin. Moreover the encoder could be used to process new input samples, after manipulating their latent attribute representation, the decoder can generate sample variations as an audio effect would. Our solution remains rather fast to train, it can directly be applied to other sound domains, including an user's libraries with custom sound tags that could be mapped to specific generative controls. As a result, it fosters creativity and intuitive audio style experimentations."

  abstract: The ubiquity of sound synthesizers has reshaped music production and even entirely defined new music genres. However, the increasing complexity and number of parameters in modern synthesizers make them harder to master. Hence, the development of methods allowing to easily create and explore with synthesizers is a crucial need. Here, we introduce a novel formulation of audio synthesizer control. We formalize it as finding an organized latent audio space that represents the capabilities of a synthesizer, while constructing an invertible mapping to the space of its parameters. By using this formulation, we show that we can address simultaneously automatic parameter inference, macro-control learning and audio-based preset exploration within a single model. To solve this new formulation, we rely on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Normalizing Flows (NF) to organize and map the respective auditory and parameter spaces. We introduce the disentangling flows, which allow to perform the invertible mapping between separate latent spaces, while steering the organization of some latent dimensions to match target variation factors by splitting the objective as partial density evaluation. We evaluate our proposal against a large set of baseline models and show its superiority in both parameter inference and audio reconstruction. We also show that the model disentangles the major factors of audio variations as latent dimensions, that can be directly used as macro-parameters. We also show that our model is able to learn semantic controls of a synthesizer by smoothly mapping to its parameters. Finally, we discuss the use of our model in creative applications and its real-time implementation in Ableton Live.

  arxiv: 1810.00222
  abstract: Generative models have been successfully applied to image style transfer and domain translation. However, there is still a wide gap in the quality of results when learning such tasks on musical audio. Furthermore, most translation models only enable one-to-one or one-to-many transfer by relying on separate encoders or decoders and complex, computationally-heavy models. In this paper, we introduce the Modulated Variational auto-Encoders (MoVE) to perform musical timbre transfer. We define timbre transfer as applying parts of the auditory properties of a musical instrument onto another. First, we show that we can achieve this task by conditioning existing domain translation techniques with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Then, we alleviate the need for additional adversarial networks by replacing the usual translation criterion by a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) objective. This allows a faster and more stable training along with a controllable latent space encoder. By further conditioning our system on several different instruments, we can generalize to many-to-many transfer within a single variational architecture able to perform multi-domain transfers. Our models map inputs to 3-dimensional representations, successfully translating timbre from one instrument to another and supporting sound synthesis from a reduced set of control parameters. We evaluate our method in reconstruction and generation tasks while analyzing the auditory descriptor distributions across transferred domains. We show that this architecture allows for generative controls in multi-domain transfer, yet remaining light, fast to train and effective on small datasets.

  abstract: Generative models aim to understand the properties of data, through the construction of latent spaces that allow classification and generation. However, as the learning is unsupervised, the latent dimensions are not related to perceptual properties. In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments. Finally, we exhibit the generative capabilities of our spaces, that can directly synthesize sounds with continuous evolution of timbre perception.
